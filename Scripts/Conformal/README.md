# Conformal
Contains scripts for basic functionality like simulation experiment setup, visualization, etc.

## cos_cp
NNCP special case where d(x,y) = -cos(x,y) and a variant for patch descriptors (e.g., DINO)

## lrt_cp
NNCP special case with difference of squared Euclidean distance (two-sample case)

## nncp
General NNCP template class providing the basic conformal functions (score, p-value, prediction etc.)

## norm_cp
NNCP special case with Euclidean distance (one-sample case)
